# python-challenge

In this repository you can find 4 files for the challenge #3. Two of them are the python code and the other two are txt files that display the results.

In the first program we analized the financial data from a company. The dataset is a csv file and we need to read this database using python.

In the second analysis we explored a vote counting process database. As well as the first exercise, we use python to read the csv file.

For both scenarios, we are exporting the results to a txt file. Feel free to run the python code and you will be able to get the same files.

Important: You need to create the folder "PyBank" and "PyPoll" at the same level where you save the python files.
